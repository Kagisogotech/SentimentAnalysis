- Detects **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** tones
- Real-time feedback with a simple and intuitive UI
- Built with React and TypeScript for modular and type-safe development
- Deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **NLP / Sentiment Engine:** *(update this with what you used, e.g. Hugging Face API, TensorFlow.js, or custom logic)*  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
